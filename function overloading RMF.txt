This project demonstrates the concept of function overloading in C++. 
It includes multiple sum functions that handle different parameter types and counts, showcasing how C++ allows multiple functions with the same name but different signatures.

Features
Function Overloading:
Sums two integers.
Sums two doubles.
Sums three integers.
Demonstrates C++'s ability to differentiate functions based on their parameter types and counts.
