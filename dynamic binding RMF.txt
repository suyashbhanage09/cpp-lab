This project demonstrates the concept of polymorphism in C++ using a simple class hierarchy of animals.
The base class Animal provides a virtual function speak(), which is overridden by derived classes Dog and Cat to produce specific animal sounds. 
The use of pointers to the base class allows for dynamic binding at runtime.
Base class Animal with a virtual speak() method.
Derived classes Dog and Cat with overridden speak() methods.
Function makeAnimalSpeak() that calls the speak() method on an Animal pointer.
Demonstrates polymorphism and dynamic binding in C++.
Code Structure
Animal.h: Header file containing the Animal class definition.
Dog.h: Header file for the Dog class, inheriting from Animal.
Cat.h: Header file for the Cat class, inheriting from Animal.
main.cpp: Contains the main() function and demonstrates theÂ functionality.
