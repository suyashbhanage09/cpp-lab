This project demonstrates a simple bank account management system implemented in C++.
It defines a BankAccount class that allows users to perform basic banking operations such as depositing and withdrawing funds, as well as checking the account balance and displaying account details.
Class Definition: Encapsulates account information (account number and balance).
Deposit Functionality: Allows the user to add money to the account.
Withdrawal Functionality: Enables the user to withdraw money while ensuring sufficient funds are available.
Balance Inquiry: Provides a method to check the current balance.
Account Details Display: Displays account information in a user-friendly format.
You can modify the initial account number and balance in the main() function to test different scenarios.
Additionally, you can enhance the program by adding more features, such as user input for deposits and withdrawals or the ability to create multiple bank accounts.
